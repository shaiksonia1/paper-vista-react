We envisaged that the trend of COVID-19 deaths per day in Ghana portrays a general increase from the onset of the pandemic in the country to about day 160 after which there is a general decrease onward. We fitted a zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model and zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model to the data in the partial-likelihood framework. The zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model outperformed the zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model. On the other hand, the dynamic zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model performed better than the dynamic negative binomial autoregressive model. The predicted new death based on the zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model indicated that Ghana's COVID-19 death per day will rise sharply few days after 30<sup>th</sup> November 2020 and drastically fall just as in the observed data.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Kassim Tawiah et al.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

        "abstract": "<Abstract>\n                <AbstractText>Infecting millions of people, causing around two million deaths, and affecting billions of people worldwide during January 2021, the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not merely one pandemic but many. These many pandemics, which I identify herein, have revealed the overt and subtle entanglements among religion, science, and politics around COVID-19. Building on my current ethnographic research on COVID-19 using purposive sampling and interview guide in Pakistan, and borrowing from various anthropological concepts such as \"social drama,\" proposed by Victor Turner, and ritual, I have developed a concept that I call <i>rituals of containment</i>. With this concept, I extend my previous argument regarding \"symbolic ownership\" to show a visible \"body politics\" by demonstrating how religion, science, and politics around COVID-19 are entangled at individual and government levels. This has become observable through the rituals of the Pakistani government of containment to deal with COVID-19. Such entanglements are visible in the case of strategies to tackle infected \"viral bodies,\" as the government has enacted its authority: (1) to bury what I am terming the <i>dead viral body</i> without its beloved ones present; (2) to return or not to return this body to family members in a coffin; (3) or to provide the grieving family with a symbolic empty coffin. These Covidian politics have led to the question: Who in actuality owns the body? In conclusion, I argue that the problem lies in the discriminatory and contradictory rituals of containment of the government, not in using scientific evidence and guidelines.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Ali.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

        "abstract": "<Abstract>\n                <AbstractText>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created significant challenges for outpatient healthcare providers and patients across the United States (U.S.). Forty-one Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), who provide a wide spectrum of health services for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations and other underinsured and uninsured populations in urban areas across the country, are no exception. The National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH), in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), set out to understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities for improvement in infection prevention and control (IPC) training and systems from the perspective of UIO frontline healthcare workers. As part of the CDC's <i>Project Firstline</i>, NCUIH was chosen as a partner in a national collaborative. The first task was to conduct listening sessions with frontline UIO staff to learn more about IPC practices in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty staff from 16 UIOs, representing full ambulatory, limited ambulatory, outreach and referral, and outpatient and residential treatment programs participated in virtual video focus groups in July of 2020. Thematic and content analysis protocols guided data analysis and coding. Analysis of findings generated four major themes: staff adaptation in the context of resilience; responsibility and duty to protect patients, families, and coworkers; mental and emotional issues for UIO staff; and IPC challenges in the context of COVID-19. Participants' challenges ranged from lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) to the absence of standardized training. Significant disparities in social determinants of health experienced by Native American and non-Native populations served by UIOs create additional challenges to the delivery of and access to care during the pandemic. The diverse array of tribal cultural values and contexts of the people and communities served by UIOs reportedly serve as both facilitators and barriers to care, awareness, and uptake of infectious disease public health practices.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Collins, Crowder, Ishcomer-Aazami and Apedjihoun.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

The COVID-19 pandemic poses a challenge for clinicians caring for sarcoidosis patients who may be at increased risk of infection compared to the general population. With the recent availability of COVID-19 vaccines, it is expected that clinicians raise questions regarding efficacy and safety in sarcoidosis. However, studies examining safety and efficacy of vaccines in sarcoidosis are lacking. In this review, we examine the current literature regarding vaccination in immunocompromised populations and apply them to sarcoidosis patients. The available literature suggests that vaccines are safe and effective in patients with autoimmune disorders and in those taking immunosuppressive medications. We strongly recommend the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with sarcoidosis. We also present a clinical decision algorithm to provide guidance on vaccination of sarcoidosis patients against COVID-19.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Manansala, Chopra, Baughman, Novak, Lower, Culver, Korsten, Drake, Judson and Sweiss.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

There are no studies assessing the impact of diagnostic delay on COVID-19 related PE. The aim of our exploratory study was to assess the diagnostic delay of PE in COVID-19 patients, and to identify potential associations between patient- or physician-related variables and the delay. This is a single-center observational retrospective study that included 29 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the San Matteo Hospital Foundation between February and May 2020, with a diagnosis of PE, and a control population of 23 non-COVID-19 patients admitted at our hospital during the same time lapse in 2019. We calculated the patient-related delay (i.e., the time between the onset of the symptoms and the first medical examination), and the physician-related delay (i.e., the time between the first medical examination and the diagnosis of PE). The overall diagnostic delay significantly correlated with the physician-related delay (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), with the tendency to a worse outcome in long physician-related diagnostic delay (<i>p</i> = 0.04). The delay was related to the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase. It is important to rule out PE as soon as possible, in order to start the right therapy, to improve patient's outcome and to shorten the hospitalization.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Melazzini, Reduzzi, Quaglini, Fumoso, Lenti and Di Sabatino.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model, presented as a nomogram and scale, to identify infectious acute abdomen patients with suspected COVID-19 more effectively and efficiently. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 584 COVID-19 patients and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients were enrolled. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to develop the prediction model. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated through calibration curves, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves in the training and validation cohorts. A simplified screening scale and a management algorithm were generated based on the nomogram. <b>Results:</b> Five potential COVID-19 prediction variables, fever, chest CT, WBC, CRP, and PCT, were selected, all independent predictors of multivariable logistic regression analysis, and the nomogram, named the COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration, and it was validated in the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis revealed that the CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified as the CIAAD scale. <b>Conclusion:</b> We established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons in the emergency department to use to distinguish COVID-19 patients.

From the literature point of view, the focus of most articles is on smoking as a possible general risk factor for all analyzed populations. Women tend to represent a more significant population in exposed occupations. In our mini-review, we try to dig deeper, looking for gender-related health effects of smoking in this pandemic context, its effects on the infection with this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on illness severity, and on the rate of hospitalization and mortality. Despite the fact that the male gender is reported in many articles as a predictor of a poor outcome, we suggest that further research is needed to confirm or deny these relationships. Moreover, studies focusing specifically on women in these study populations are required.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Mihaltan, Rajnoveanu and Rajnoveanu.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

However, due to the limitations of human understanding in the code of life, any possible intended or unintended uses of synthetic biology, and other unknown reasons, the development and application of this technology has raised concerns over biosafety, biosecurity, and even cyberbiosecurity that they may expose public health and the environment to unknown hazards. Over the past decades, some countries in Europe, America, and Asia have enacted laws and regulations to control the application of synthetic biology techniques in basic and applied research and this has resulted in some benefits. The outbreak of the COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and various speculations about the origin of this virus have attracted more attention on bio-risk concerns of synthetic biology because of its potential power and uncertainty in the synthesis and engineering of living organisms. Therefore, it is crucial to scrutinize the control measures put in place to ensure appropriate use, promote the development of synthetic biology, and strengthen the governance of pathogen-related research, although the true origin of coronavirus remains hotly debated and unresolved. This article reviews the recent progress made in the field of synthetic biology and combs laws and regulations in governing bio-risk issues.

Focusing on the conditions in Bali, this study explored the level of compliance to public health measures targeted at COVID-19 and identified the determinants of compliance via the values, rules, and knowledge approach. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey using the Google Form application from June 29 to July 5, 2020. The minimum required sample size was 664. Inclusion criteria were set as follows: 18 years of age or older and residing in Bali during the data collection period. Adherence was measured based on nine protocol indicators that were rated using a four-point Likert scale. A multiple linear regression analysis was then conducted to determine the associated factors of adherence to public health measures. <b>Results:</b> Of the 954 survey respondents, data from 743 were included for analysis. The average level of adherence to public health measures was 32.59 (range of 20-36). The linear regression analysis showed that perceived health benefits from public health measures, being female, and having COVID-19 test histories were significantly associated with adherence to public health measures. <b>Conclusions:</b> For public health measures targeted at COVID-19, adherence was strongly associated with perceived social norms, in which individuals played social community roles by adapting to standardized public health measures. It is thus imperative for governments to support and monitor public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Indrayathi, Januraga, Pradnyani, Gesesew and Ward.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

We compared the case numbers of spring 2019 and spring 2020 and analyzed alterations in the diagnostic spectrum. Finally, we analyzed the age, gender, and diagnoses of patients tested positive for COVID-19. <b>Results:</b> A total of 25,612 inpatient psychiatric hospital admissions were assessed. Case rates decreased by 25% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes varied between diagnostic groups, and there were even increases in case numbers for certain diagnoses. Women and patients of higher ages were overrepresented among psychiatric inpatients with COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in considerable reductions in the total number of mental health-care admissions and in changes in the diagnostic spectrum. The results may be explainable by deferrals of elective hospital admissions during the acute phase of the pandemic and by destabilizing effects of the pandemic and social distancing on people with mental disorders.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Zielasek, Vrinssen and Gouzoulis-Mayfrank.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

There is an immediate need for a simple, rapid, early and sensitive point-of-care testing for COVID-19 disease. However, current testing approaches do not meet such need. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based detection methods have received substantial attention for nucleic acid-based molecular testing due to their simplicity, high sensitivity and specificity. This review explores the various CRISPR-based COVID-19 detection methods and related diagnostic devices. As with any emerging technology, CRISPR/Cas-based nucleic acid testing methods have several challenges that must be overcome for practical applications in clinics and hospitals. More importantly, these detection methods are not limited to COVID-19 but can be applied to detect any type of pathogen, virus, and fungi that may threaten humans, agriculture, and food industries in resource-limited settings. CRISPR/Cas-based detection methods have the potential to become simpler, more reliable, more affordable, and faster in the near future, which is highly important for achieving point-of-care diagnostics.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Ganbaatar and Liu.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

Droplets and contacts serve as the main route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The characteristic of the disease is rather heterogeneous, ranging from no symptoms to critical illness. The factors associated with the outcome of COVID-19 have not been completely characterized to date. Inspired by previous studies on the relevance of infectious diseases, viral and host factors related to clinical outcomes have been identified. The severity of COVID-19 is mainly related to host factors, especially cellular immune responses in patients. Patients with mild COVID-19 and improved patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a normal immune response to effectively eliminate the virus. The immune response in patients with fatal severe COVID-19 includes three stages: normal or hypofunction, hyperactivation, and anergy. Eventually, the patients were unable to resist viral infection and died. Based on our understanding of the kinetics of immune responses during COVID-19, we suggest that type I interferon (IFN) could be administered to patients with severe COVID-19 in the hypofunctional stage, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoid therapy could be administered in the immune hyperactivation stage. In addition, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulation therapy and anti-infective therapy with antibiotics are recommended in the hyperactivation stage.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Zhou and Ye.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

Approved drugs including Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir or Interferon were reported to inhibit the infection or propagation of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), however, their clinical efficacies have not yet been well demonstrated. To identify drugs with higher antiviral potency, we screened approved anti-parasitic/anti-protozoal drugs and identified an anti-malarial drug, Mefloquine, which showed the highest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity among the tested compounds. Mefloquine showed higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity than Hydroxychloroquine in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells, with IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.28 \u03bcM, IC<sub>90</sub> = 2.31 \u03bcM, and IC<sub>99</sub> = 4.39 \u03bcM in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Mefloquine inhibited viral entry after viral attachment to the target cell. Combined treatment with Mefloquine and Nelfinavir, a replication inhibitor, showed synergistic antiviral activity. Our mathematical modeling based on the drug concentration in the lung predicted that Mefloquine administration at a standard treatment dosage could decline viral dynamics in patients, reduce cumulative viral load to 7% and shorten the time until virus elimination by 6.1 days. These data cumulatively underscore Mefloquine as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Shionoya, Yamasaki, Iwanami, Ito, Fukushi, Ohashi, Saso, Tanaka, Aoki, Kuramochi, Iwami, Takahashi, Suzuki, Muramatsu, Takeda, Wakita and Watashi.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

The role of fat distribution, particularly visceral fat (often linked to metabolic abnormalities), is still unclear. The adipose tissue represents a direct source of cytokines responsible for the pathological modifications occurring within adipose tissue in obese subjects. Adipokines are a crucial connection between metabolism and immune system: their dysregulation in obesity contributes to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and metabolic comorbidities. Therefore the increased amount of visceral fat can lead to a proinflammatory phenotypic shift. This review analyzes the interrelation between obesity and COVID-19 severity, as well as the cellular key players and molecular mechanisms implicated in adipose inflammation, investigating if adipose tissue can constitute a reservoir for viral spread, and contribute to immune activation and cytokines storm.

Recent advances in the field of behavioral immune system (BIS) research suggest that humans are equipped with a set of psychological adaptations enabling them to detect the disease-threat and activate behavioral avoidance of pathogens. The present study, set within PMT framework and informed by the BIS research, aimed to explain and predict voluntary adherence to COVID-19 guidelines by perceived personal risk and vulnerability to disease as threat appraisal variables, and trust in science as the response efficacy element of coping appraisal. Gender, age, belief in the second wave, perceived personal risk, germ aversion, and trust in science were all found to be significant positive predictors of the intent to adhere to non-pharmacological COVID-19 recommendations, with the belief in the second wave, germ aversion, and trust in science being the most important ones. On the other hand, only the belief in the second wave and trust in science were significant positive predictors of the intent to adhere to pharmacological COVID-19 recommendations (i.e., to vaccinate).

Students with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis reported higher levels of loneliness compared to a matched sample of non-students, and more avoidant coping and negative emotional coping than students without a diagnosis. Qualitative data illustrate how parenting intersects with well-being and stress as both a protective and risk factor for women university students. This research report adds to the evidence base on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the student population, and how pre-existing mental health diagnoses intersect with coping behaviours and vulnerability in women students. Exploration of potential vulnerabilities can provide opportunities for targeted support, and identifying effective coping has the potential to inform effective interventions.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Misca and Thornton.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

However, the authors propose that the multiple definitions of self-transcendence within existing literature lean towards the complex, sometimes obscure, and imprecisely spiritual. A concern is that this creates a circumstance, where the possibility of supporting self-transcendence in a wider population will become excluding in this complexity. In this paper, we have undertaken a critical summary review focused primarily on historical foundations of the concept of self-transcendence, and key theoretical approaches in which self-transcendence and self-transcendent experiences are discussed with the motive of finding a clarity to understanding self-transcendence and the pathways towards it. We argue that this much-needed clarity in our understanding of self-transcendence may serve as an inclusive and democratized resource in which to support well-being and resilience in the context of COVID and beyond.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Worth and Smith.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

        "authors": "Ivana Hromatko, Andrea Grus, Gabrijela Kol\u0111eraj",
        "abstract": "<Abstract>\n                <AbstractText>Insular populations have traditionally drawn a lot of attention from epidemiologists as they provide important insights regarding transmission of infectious diseases and propagation of epidemics. There are numerous historical instances where isolated populations showed high morbidity once a new virus entered the population. Building upon that and recent findings that the activation of the behavioral immune system (BIS) depends both upon one's vulnerability and environmental context, we predicted that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, place of residence (island vs. mainland) explains a significant proportion of variance in preferred interpersonal distances, animosity toward strangers, and willingness to punish those who do not adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. With 48 populated islands, Croatia provides a fruitful testing ground for this prediction. We also opted to explore relations among BIS-related variables (pathogen disgust, germ aversion, and perceived infectability) and social cognitions in a more natural context than has previously been done. The study was conducted online, on Croatian residents, during April and May 2020. As expected, the BIS variables contributed significantly to preferred interpersonal distances, negative emotions toward strangers, and willingness to punish those who do not adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. Furthermore, our results showed that geographical location explained a significant amount of variance in preferred social (but not personal and intimate) distances and negative emotions toward foreigners. As Croatian islands are extremely frequent travel destinations, these differences between mainlanders and islanders cannot be explained by the lack of exposure to foreigners. Additionally, we found that scores on preferred interpersonal distances, pathogen disgust, and germ aversion were significantly higher compared to those obtained in Croatian samples before the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, men scored higher in perceived infectability than before the COVID-19 pandemic, and women did not, which reflects the objectively higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 for men than for women. Taken together, our results support the notion that BIS is a highly adaptive and context-dependent response system, likely more reactive in more susceptible individuals.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Hromatko, Grus and Kol\u0111eraj.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

Pregnant women are a high-risk population for COVID-19. However, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and related factors is unknown in Chinese pregnant women during COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and the related factors in Chinese pregnant women who were attending crisis intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> The data of this cross-sectional study were collected in about 2 months (February 28 to April 26, 2020). Data analysis was performed from April to May 2020. Participants completed a set of questionnaires via the Wechat Mini-program before starting the online self-help crisis intervention for COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 2,120 Chinese pregnant women who were attending a self-help crisis intervention participated in this study. A survey was developed to address possible stress-related factors in pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak, including demographic, socioeconomic, and pregnancy-related factors, as well as COVID-19 related factors. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the 10-item perceived stress scale were, respectively, employed to measure anxiety and stress-related factors. <b>Results:</b> A total of 21.7% (459) of pregnant women reported at least mild anxiety (\u22655 on the GAD-7 scale), and only 82 women reported moderate to severe anxiety (\u226510 on the GAD-7 scale). Factors associated with at least mild anxiety included living in Hubei province (<i>OR</i> = 1.68, <i>95% CI</i> = 1.32-2.13), nobody providing everyday life support (<i>OR</i> = 1.81, <i>95% CI</i> = 1.18-2.77), pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding (<i>OR</i> = 1.67, <i>95% CI</i> = 1.32-2.09), and higher perceived stress (<i>OR</i> = 6.87, <i>95% CI</i> = 5.42-9.02). Having relatives or neighbors with a diagnosis of COVID-19 was not associated with anxiety (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions and Relevance:</b> Our findings indicate that evaluation and intervention for maternal and infant health are necessary in pregnant women with anxiety during COVID-19 epidemic, especially those with higher perceived stress, less everyday life support, or vaginal bleeding.

After its inception, the virus proliferated rapidly, which led to the cause of millions of deaths, and having a detrimental effect on physical health, social lives, economic uncertainty, and mental health of people. The World Health Organization has reported that there are 111 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2.45 million deaths due to COVID-19 worldwide. Indisputably, the present pandemic has contributed to the extensive psychological and environmental distress together with clinical depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), domestic violence, and unemployment. Due to the ambiguous nature of the pandemic, educational organizations, and outdoor activities are closed, thus burdening the mental health of younger populations. Children as well as youths are more glued to the Internet for their studies, online gaming, shopping, watching movies, and searching health-related information. Despite the advantages of using the Internet, it has some severe consequences too. Some people are repeatedly searching for physical and mental well-being related information without verifying credible sources, which, in turn, causes distress and anxiety. In such situations, individuals may end up contributing to an illness known as cyberchondria. In this paper, we have tried to highlight the problematic use of Internet for health-related searches and have outlined the management of such illness. We suggest two strategies: firstly, to reduce repeated online searches of health information and, secondly, to manage anxiety-augmenting thoughts that are triggered due to the maladaptive thoughts caused by the abstruse information.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Varma, Das and Singh.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

Clinical studies have found that the virus can cause dyspnea, pneumonia and other cardiopulmonary system damage. In severe cases, it can lead to respiratory failure and even death. Although there are currently no effective drugs or vaccines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, the patient's prognosis recovery can be effectively improved by ameliorating the dysfunction of the respiratory system, cardiovascular systems, and immune function. Intermittent hypoxic preconditioning (IHP) as a new non-drug treatment has been applied in the clinical and rehabilitative practice for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, and other diseases. Many clinical studies have confirmed that IHP can improve the cardiopulmonary function of patients and increase the cardiorespiratory fitness and the tolerance of tissues and organs to ischemia. This article introduces the physiological and biochemical functions of IHP and proposes the potential application plan of IHP for the rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19, so as to provide a better prognosis for patients and speed up the recovery of the disease. The aim of this narrative review is to propose possible causes and pathophysiology of COVID-19 based on the mechanisms of the oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune response, and to provide a new, safe and efficacious strategy for the better rehabilitation from COVID-19.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Cai, Chen, Shan, Yang, Guo, Bi, Xu, Shi, Chu and Wang.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

A regression analysis of municipality data reveals that the number of users of adult daycare is negatively correlated to COVID-19, both nationally and regionally. This finding is intuitive because people avoid daycare due to the increased risk of exposure to infection. However, the number of users of home care is positively correlated to users of daycare, which implies that home care has not functioned as a replacement for daycare, despite government encouragement. Furthermore, a regression analysis using prefecture data shows that working hours for both females and males were negatively correlated to the national status of the pandemic, while the regional status of the pandemic was negatively correlated only to female working hours. This implies that female labor status is more vulnerable to such outbreaks in Japan. Also, we find consistent results with a situation in which informal care compensated for the decline in daycare use; and this care has been provided primarily by especially females who have reduced their working hours by COVID-19.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Its increased severity was noted in aged patients usually over 65 years of age. Children and young people have an asymptomatic or mild course of the disease.Unfortunately, the number of children with problems after mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 recovery is increasing and their troubles resemble Kawasaki disease, although the laboratory findings seem to be different. This condition is called pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS), and it is a new disease seen in children directly influenced by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The literature reports that PIMS typically follows 2-4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical symptoms of the affected children are extremely complex, ranging from gastrointestinal to cardiovascular problems with frequent skin and mucosal manifestations, and without intensive treatment they can be fatal. The exact causes of PIMS are recently unknown, however, it is explained as hyperactivation of immunity.In this minireview, we summarize data on the prominent role of the IL-6-IL-6R-STAT3 axis in PIMS aetiopathogenesis.

Recently, numbers of epidemiological studies have illustrated that climate conditions and air pollutants are associated with the COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide. Researches also suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in fecal and wastewater samples. These findings provided the possibility of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic from an environmental perspective. With this review, the main purpose is to summarize the relationship between the atmospheric and wastewater environment and COVID-19. In terms of the atmospheric environment, the evidence of the relationship between atmospheric environment (climate factors and air pollution) and COVID-19 is growing, but currently available data and results are various. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze their associations to provide constructive suggestions in responding to the pandemic. Recently, large numbers of studies have shown the widespread presence of this virus in wastewater and the feasibility of wastewater surveillance when the pandemic is ongoing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to clarify the occurrence and implication of viruses in wastewater and to understand the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology of pandemic. Overall, environmental perspective-based COVID-19 studies can provide new insight into pandemic prevention and control, and minimizes the economic cost for COVID-19 in areas with a large outbreak or a low economic level.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

By mid-March 2021, the COVID-19 almost hit all countries worldwide, with about 122 and 2.7 million confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. As a strong measure to stop the infection spread and deaths, many countries have enforced quarantine and lockdown of many activities. The shutdown of these activities has resulted in large economic losses. However, it has been widely reported that these measures have resulted in improved air quality, more specifically in highly polluted areas characterized by massive population and industrial activities. The reduced levels of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and particulate matter emissions have been reported and confirmed worldwide in association with lockdown periods. On the other hand, ozone levels in ambient air have been found to increase, mainly in response to the reduced nitrogen emissions. In addition, improved water quality in natural water resources has been reported as well. Wastewater facilities have reported a higher level of organic load with persistent chemicals due to the increased use of sanitizers, disinfectants, and antibiotics. The solid waste generated due to the COVID-19 pandemic was found to increase both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work presents and summarizes the observed environmental effects of COVID-19 as reported in the literature for different countries worldwide. The work provides a distinct overview considering the effects imposed by COVID-19 on the air, water, wastewater, and solid waste as critical elements of the environment.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The simplicity, low invasive and possibility of self-collection of saliva imposed these specimens as a relevant alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the discrepancy of saliva test results compared to NPSs made of its use controversial. Here, we assessed Salivettes\u00ae, as a standardized saliva collection device, and compared SARS-CoV-2 positivity on paired NPS and saliva specimens. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 303 individuals randomly selected among those investigated for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, including 30 (9.9%) patients previously positively tested using NPS (follow-up group), 90 (29.7%) mildly symptomatic and 183 (60.4%) asymptomatic. <b>Results:</b> The RT-qPCR revealed a positive rate of 11.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a035) and 17.2% (n\u00a0=\u00a052) for NPSs and saliva samples, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of saliva samples were 82.9% and 91.4%, respectively, using NPS as reference. The highest proportion of discordant results concerned the follow-up group (33.3%). Although the agreement exceeded 90.0% in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, 17 individuals were detected positive only in saliva samples, with consistent medical arguments. <b>Conclusion</b> Saliva collected with Salivette\u00ae was more sensitive for detecting symptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

This article reflects on the role of continuing education in healthcare as a strategic element in ensuring the occupational health of community healthcare agents faced with combating and managing coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19). In the current scenario, the work of community healthcare agents is undergoing daily reconstruction of professional practice in order to keep pace with the living territories to which they are assigned. Continuing education in healthcare enables construction of feasible scenarios that make problem solving possible, involving a constant reflective analytical perception of professional practices, permitting (re)construction of social skills such as the capacity to mobilize and motivate other actors to participate in political action. Through problematization, identification of needs, and questioning, continuing education in healthcare leads to (de)construction of the working practices of the very actors who are delivering care. Furthermore, continuing education in healthcare reaffirms the importance of the social, technical, and political training of community healthcare agents, thereby confirming their right to dignified and quality work. In a pandemic scenario, an agenda focused on continuing education in healthcare is essential to the continuity of care delivery to communities, facilitating expansion of access to the right to health.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>",

The illness can have long-term consequences for patients, affecting their functional capacity and, consequently, their occupational performance. This study analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on occupational health, with a focus on the importance of physical therapy in rehabilitation. An integrative literature review was conducted based on articles retrieved from the PubMed, SciELO, and LILACS databases using the following keywords: COVID-19, physical therapy, rehabilitation, and occupational health. The search retrieved 1,308 studies, 15 of which met inclusion criteria for the review. A thorough assessment of the articles revealed four topics that corresponded to the results of this study: 1) effects of COVID-19 on occupational health; 2) physical therapy in mild and moderate cases without hospitalization; 3) physical therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; 4) physical therapy in post-intensive care unit (ICU) recovery and after hospital discharge. The findings showed that COVID-19 can affect several physiological systems and have both short- and long-term effects on patients, including physical and psychological impairments. Physical therapists must be involved in the battle against this illness to help patients recover their physical function and return to work as quickly, safely, and effectively as possible.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>",

To reduce the risk, protective measures must be adopted and personal protective equipment is essential. However, the process of removing personal protective equipment, named doffing, is as important as its correct use and can be a source of contamination for workers, especially when equipment is lacking in the market and lifespan is increased. Therefore, this review aimed to discuss the process of doffing personal protective equipment and its correct sequence based on data available in the literature.</AbstractText>\n            </Abstract>",

The objectives of this study were to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and the COVID-19 cases at the community-level and to assess how SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations should be integrated into a wastewater-based epidemiological statistical model that can provide reliable forecasts for the number of COVID-19 infections and the evolution over time as well. Weekly variations on the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and COVID-19 cases from April 29, 2020 through February 17, 2021 were obtained in Borough of Indiana, PA. Vector autoregression (VAR) model with different data forms were fitted on this data from April 29, 2020 through January 27, 2021, and the performance in three weeks ahead forecasting (February 3, 10, and 17) were compared with measures of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). A stationary block bootstrapping VAR method was also presented to reduce the variability in the forecasting values. Our results demonstrate that VAR(1) estimated with the logged data has the best interpretation of the data, but a VAR(1) estimated with the original data has a stronger forecasting ability. The forecast accuracy, measured by MAPE, for 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks in the future can be as low as 11.85%, 8.97% and 21.57%. The forecasting performance of the model on a short time span is unfortunately not very impressive. Also, a single increase in the SARS-CoV-2 concentration can impact the COVID-19 cases in an inverted-U shape pattern with the maximum impact occur in the third week after. The flexibility of this approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different locations where the wastewater surveillance system has been implemented.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In-hospital mortality rates, adjusted for covariates, declined from 33-34% in March to 11-12% in September. Compared to the March-May period, Bangladeshi, Indian and Other Asian ethnicity patients had a lower relative odds of death (compared to White ethnicity patients) during June-September.

We conducted the largest systematic review of the literature addressing the utility of AI in imaging for COVID-19 patient care. By keyword searches on PubMed and preprint servers throughout 2020, we identified 463 manuscripts and performed a systematic meta-analysis to assess their technical merit and clinical relevance. Our analysis evidences a significant disparity between clinical and AI communities, both in the focus on imaging modalities (AI experts neglected CT and Ultrasound, favoring X-Ray) and performed tasks (71.9% of AI papers centered on diagnosis). The vast majority of manuscripts were found deficient regarding potential use in clinical practice, but 2.7% (N=12) publications were assigned a high maturity level and are summarized in greater detail. We provide an itemized discussion of the challenges in developing clinically relevant AI solutions with recommendations and remedies.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2021 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

In such scenarios, overlapping symptoms pose serious diagnostic challenges. The delayed diagnosis may lead to an increase in disease severity and catastrophic events. Recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected various areas globally, including malaria-endemic regions. The <i>Plasmodium</i> and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection and its effect on the health are yet unexplored. We present a case report of a previously healthy, middle-aged individual from the malaria-endemic area who suffered SARS-CoV-2 and <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> co-infection. The patient developed severe disease indications in the short time period. The patient showed neurological symptoms, altered hematological as well as liver-test parameters, and subsequent death in a narrow time-span. We hereby discuss the various aspects of this case regarding treatment and hematological parameters. Further, we have put forward perspectives related to the mechanism behind severity and neurological symptoms in this fatal parasite-virus co-infection case. In malaria-endemic regions, due to overlapping symptoms, suspected COVID-19 patients should also be monitored for diagnosis of malaria without any delay. The SARS-CoV-2 and <i>Plasmodium</i> co-infection could increase the disease severity in a short time span. In treatment, dexamethasone may not help in severe case having malaria as well as COVID-19 positive status and needs further exploration.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2021 Chinese Medical Association Publishing House.

There is no report of any clinically endorsed antiviral medications or antibodies that are successful against COVID-19. It has quickly spread everywhere, presenting tremendous well-being, financial, ecological, and social difficulties to the whole human populace. The COVID flare-up is seriously disturbing the worldwide economy. Practically all the countries are battling to hinder the transmission of the malady by testing and treating patients, isolating speculated people through contact following, confining huge social affairs, keeping up total or incomplete lockdown, etc. Proper scheduling of nursing workers and optimal designation of nurses may significantly affect the quality of clinical facilities. It is delivered by eliminating unbalanced workloads or undue stress, which could lead to decreased nurse performance and potential human errors., Nurses are frequently asked to leave while caring for all sick patients. However, regular scheduling formulas are not thought to consider this possibility because they are out of scheduling control in typical scenarios. In this paper, a novel model of the Hybrid Salp Swarm Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (HSSAGA) is proposed to solve nurses' scheduling and designation. The findings of the suggested test function algorithm demonstrate that this algorithm has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We are able to remove the lungs from the images by turning to black the center of the X-Ray scan and training our classifiers only on the outer part of the images. Hence, we deduce that several testing protocols for the recognition are not fair and that the neural networks are learning patterns in the dataset that are not correlated to the presence of COVID-19. Finally, we show that creating a fair testing protocol is a challenging task, and we provide a method to measure how fair a specific testing protocol is. In the future research we suggest to check the fairness of a testing protocol using our tools and we encourage researchers to look for better techniques than the ones that we propose.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

There was an urgent need to look for the remedy and control this deadly disease. A new strain of coronavirus called Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was considered to be responsible for COVID-19. Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the family of coronaviruses crowned with homotrimeric class 1 fusion spike protein (or S protein) on their surfaces. COVID-19 attacks primarily at our throat and lungs epithelial cells. In COVID-19, a stronger adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 can lead to longer recovery time and leads to several complications. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for examining the consequence of adaptive immune responses to the viral mutation to control disease transmission. We consider three populations, namely, the uninfected epithelial cells, infected cells, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also take into account combination drug therapy on the dynamics of COVID-19 and its effect. We present a fractional-order model representing COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells. The main aim of our study is to explore the effect of adaptive immune response using fractional order operator to monitor the influence of memory on the cell-biological aspects. Also, we have studied the outcome of an antiviral drug on the system to obstruct the contact between epithelial cells and SARS-CoV-2 to restrict the COVID-19 disease. Numerical simulations have been done to illustrate our analytical findings.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

One strategy that attracted significant attention was the use of digital contact-tracing apps to quickly alert users of possible exposure to the virus, and to direct them into quarantine. The initially high expectations placed upon this strategy were not met-despite the implementation of a\u00a0digital contact-tracing app in Germany, further restrictions have been placed on the general population in response to further waves of the virus.

For the modeling process, the data published by the daily technical report COVID-19 in Mexico from March 19th to September 30th were used. The data published in the month of October were included to carry out the prediction. The results show a satisfactory comparison between the real data and those obtained by both models with a R<sup>2</sup>\u2009&gt;\u20090.999. The Levenberg-Marquardt and BFGS quasi-Newton optimization algorithm were favorable for fitting the coefficients during learning in the ANN model due to their fast and precision, respectively. On the other hand, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm fitted the parameters of the Gompertz model faster by minimizing the sum of squares. Therefore, the ANN model better fits the real data using ten coefficients. However, the Gompertz model using three parameters converges in less computational time. In the prediction, the inverse ANN model was solved by a genetic algorithm obtaining the best precision with a maximum error of 2.22% per day, as opposed to the 5.48% of the Gompertz model with respect to the real data reported from November 1st to 15th. Finally, according to the coefficients and parameters obtained from both models with recent data, a total of 109,724 cumulative deaths for the inverse ANN model and 100,482 cumulative deaths for the Gompertz model were predicted for the end of 2020.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2021.</CopyrightInformation>\n            </Abstract>",

Airborne transmission has been recognized as one of the major transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating the effectiveness of multi-scale IAQ control strategies in mitigating the infection risk in different scenarios. The IAQ control strategies across multiple scales from a whole building to rooms, and to cubical and personal microenvironments and breathing zone, are introduced, including elevated outdoor airflow rates, high-efficiency filters, advanced air distribution strategies, standalone air cleaning technologies, personal ventilation and face masks. The effectiveness of these strategies for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection are evaluated for specific indoor spaces, including long-term care facility, school and college, meat plant, retail stores, hospital, office, correctional facility, hotel, restaurant, casino and transportation spaces like airplane, cruise ship, subway, bus and taxi, where airborne transmission are more likely to occur due to high occupancy densities. The baseline cases of these spaces are established according to the existing standards, guidelines or practices. Several integrated mitigation strategies are recommended and classified based on their relative cost and effort of implementation for each indoor space. They can be applied to help meet the current challenge of ongoing COVID-19, and provide better preparation for other possible epidemics and pandemics of airborne infectious diseases in the future.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Efforts of the scientific community are turning to this global crisis and should present future preventative measures. With recent trends in polymer science that use plasma to activate and enhance the functionalities of polymer surfaces by surface etching, surface grafting, coating and activation combined with recent advances in understanding polymer-virus interactions at the nanoscale, it is promising to employ advanced plasma processing for smart antiviral applications. This trend article highlights the innovative and emerging directions and approaches in plasma-based surface engineering to create antiviral polymers. After introducing the unique features of plasma processing of polymers, novel plasma strategies that can be applied to engineer polymers with antiviral properties are presented and critically evaluated. The challenges and future perspectives of exploiting the unique plasma-specific effects to engineer smart polymers with virus-capture, virus-detection, virus-repelling, and/or virus-inactivation functionalities for biomedical applications are analysed and discussed.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2021 The Authors.

        "abstract": "<Abstract>\n                <AbstractText>Vaccines to prevent acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection elicit an immune neutralizing response. Some concerns have been raised regarding the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, largely based on case-reports of serious thromboembolic events after vaccination. Some mechanisms have been suggested which might explain the adverse cardiovascular reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Different vaccine platforms are currently available which include live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, vector vaccines, DNA vaccines and RNA vaccines. Vaccines increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells. Once synthetized, the Spike proteins assembled in the cytoplasma migrate to the cell surface and protrude with a native-like conformation. These proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response. Such response appears to be quite vigorous in the presence of DNA vaccines which encode viral vectors, as well as in subjects who are immunized because of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The resulting pathological features may resemble those of active coronavirus disease. The free-floating Spike proteins synthetized by cells targeted by vaccine and destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood and systematically interact with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed by a variety of cells including platelets, thereby promoting ACE2 internalization and degradation. These reactions may ultimately lead to platelet aggregation, thrombosis and inflammation mediated by several mechanisms including platelet ACE2 receptors. Whereas Phase III vaccine trials generally excluded participants with previous immunization, vaccination of huge populations in the real life will inevitably include individuals with preexisting immunity. This might lead to excessively enhanced inflammatory and thrombotic reactions in occasional subjects. Further research is urgently needed in this area.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V.

There was a single entry and exit for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care workers (HCW) changed gowns and gloves between patients, but maintained their N-95 mask and face shield, cleaning the shield with a germicidal wipe between patients. Staffing assignments designated nurses and technicians to remain in this area for 4\u00a0h, where physicians regularly moved between the hot zone and rest of the ED. Fifteen surface samples and four air samples were taken to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 contamination levels and the effectiveness of infection control practices. Samples were collected outside of patient rooms in 3 primary ED patient care areas, the reception area, the primary nurses station, inside the cohort area, and the PPE donning and doffing areas immediately adjacent. Samples were recovered and analyzed for the presence of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR.</AbstractText>\n                <AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on any surface samples, including in and around the cohort area.

In order to minimise the number of hospital visits for patients receiving durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic we implemented 4-weekly (20 mg/kg) durvalumab in place of 2-weekly infusions at The Royal Marsden Hospital. We assessed the potential impact of the safety of a 4-weekly schedule in patients receiving adjuvant durvalumab. We carried out a retrospective study of 40 patients treated with 2-weekly and 4-weekly infusions of durvalumab prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical documentation was analysed from 216 consultations across 40 patients receiving 2-weekly durvalumab and 66 consultations of 14 patients who switched from 2-weekly to 4-weekly durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic. In patients receiving 2-weekly durvalumab, the rate of grade 3 and 4 toxicities was 15 % compared to 7% in patients receiving 4-weekly durvalumab. Pre-existing autoimmune disease was considered a risk factor for the development of grade 3 or 4 toxicities. We did not observe any difference in the rate of grade 1 and 2 toxicities between the two groups. Our findings support the use of 4-weekly durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, obviating the need for 2-weekly face-to-face consultations and blood tests, relevant given the current pandemic and the need to re-structure cancer services to minimise patient hospital visits and exposure to SARS-CoV-2.</AbstractText>\n                <CopyrightInformation>Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

A traditional robot calibration implements either model or modelless methods. The compensation of position error in a model-less method is to move the robot's end-effector to a target position in the robot workspace, and to find the target position error online based on the measured neighboring four-point errors around the target position. For this purpose, a stereo camera or other measurement device can be used to measure offline the position errors of the robot's end-effector at predefined grid points. By using the proposed fuzzy error interpolation technique, the accuracy of the position error compensation can be greatly improved, which is confirmed by the simulation results given in this paper. A comparison study among various interpolation methods, such as bilinear, cubic spline, and the fuzzy error interpolation technique is also made via simulation. The simulation results show that more accurate compensation results can be achieved using the fuzzy error interpolation technique compared with its bilinear and cubic spline counterparts.",

        "abstract": "The potentials of mean force (PMFs) were determined for systems forming cationic and anionic homocomplexes composed of acetic acid, phenol, isopropylamine, n-butylamine, imidazole, and 4(5)-methylimidazole, and their conjugated bases or acids, respectively, in three solvents with different polarity and hydrogen-bonding propensity: acetonitrile (AN), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and water (H 2 O). For each pair and each solvent a series of umbrella-sampling molecular dynamics simulations with the AMBER force field, explicit solvent, and counterions added to maintain a zero net charge of a system were carried out and the PMF was calculated by using the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). Subsequently, homoconjugation-equilibrium constants were calculated by numerical integration of the respective PMF profiles. In all cases but imidazole stable homocomplexes were found to form in solution, which was manifested as the presence of contact minima corresponding to hydrogen-bonded species in the PMF curves. The calculated homoconjugation constants were found to be greater for complexes with the OHO bridge (acetic acid and phenol) than with the NHN bridge and they were found to decrease with increasing polarity and hydrogen-bonding propensity of the solvent (i.e., in the series AN > DMSO > H 2 O), both facts being in agreement with the available experimental data. It was also found that interactions with counterions are manifested as the broadening of the contact minimum or appearance of additional minima in the PMF profiles of the acetic acid-acetate, phenol/ phenolate system in acetonitrile, and the 4(5)-methylimidazole/4(5)-methylimidzole cation conjugated base system in dimethyl sulfoxide.",
